# Recursion

A function that refers to itself.

>Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself. AKA a function that refers to itself inside of the function.  

Example: 
- `ls -R` will list all the files inside all of the folders.

Good for:
- tasks that have repeated subtasks to do.
- searching and sorting algorithms
    - traversing a tree
