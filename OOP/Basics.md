> Versus Procedural Programming. Data in variables. Functions operating on variables. Spaghetti code = interconnections.

## 4 Pillars

1. Encapsulation
1. Abstraction
1. Inheritance
1. Polymorphism


### Encapsulation

> Reduce complexity + Increase reusability
* Combine related functions and variables into a unit aka object
    * Variables = Properties
    * Functions = Methods
    * Avoids parameters. Instead they are properties.
    * Uncle Bob - "The best functions are those with no parameters!"

### Abstraction

> Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes.
* Complexity of inner workings are hidden.
    * aka some properties and methods are hidden from the outside.
* Makes simpler interface.
* Reduces the impact of change.

### Inheritance

> Eliminate redundant code.
* If elements have common actions, rather than redefining for every type of element, should define once in a generic object, then have other objects inherit the common properties and elements.

### Polymorphism

> Refactor switch/case statements.
* Poly = Many
* Morph = Form
* Many forms.
* Eliminate long if else and switch statements.
* Define a method that behaves differently based on object referencing.
